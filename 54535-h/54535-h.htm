as pretty as the one I bought. There won’t no silly girl
get it, either. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="dr">

<p>(He starts to take it out of envelope, hears some one
coming, and runs out, dropping it. There should be
a curtain, apparently separating two rooms, and behind

<p>Enter <span class="ch">Uncle Bertram</span>; goes to desk.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> <span class="dr">(addressing his envelope)</span>. Well, well!
That’s the fortieth valentine I’ve sent Ellen. I sent the
first, I remember, when I was a three-year-old, in kilts,
and she a baby in little white dresses and blue shoes. Ha,
hum! Such is life! Here we are, both middle-aged
people, though blest if I feel so! If she’d only answered
that twentieth one, I might not have been sending the
fortieth. I wonder&mdash;&mdash; <span class="dr">(He toys with letter.)</span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. Winston</span> <span class="dr">(looking in)</span>. Oh, here you are, Bertram.
You’re wanted on the ’phone.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> <span class="dr">(rising)</span>. I’ll be right there.</p>

the dropped letter.)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby</span> <span class="dr">(going to desk)</span>. Gee! I’ve thought of the
best joke! This ain’t sealed, either. I’m a-going to
change ’em. Thirty-nine valentines are enough for one
lady to get from the same man, anybody’d know!
<span class="dr">(Makes the change, and seals both letters.)</span> There! I
guess a “change’ll be a difference,” as Aunt Emily says,
and Eloise oughtn’t to care. This one’s from Bert, too.
Didn’t know Uncle Bertram ever signed his name Bert.
Jumping frogs! He’s coming!</p>

<div class="direction">

<div class="dr">

<p>(Hides again, <span class="ch">Bert’s</span> letter in his hand. His uncle
takes the letter, and sees it is sealed.)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Funny! I thought I hadn’t sealed that.
Getting absent-minded, I guess.</p>

<div class="direction">

<div class="dr">

<p>(Puts it in pocket, and goes out, whistling.)</p>

<p>Enter <span class="ch">Evelyn</span> and <span class="ch">Helen</span>. Both start toward desk.
<span class="ch">Helen</span> reaches it first.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Oh, dear, Helen, won’t you let me have the
desk a minute? I just want to address a letter.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> So do I, and I’m in an awful rush.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> What is it? A valentine?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Is yours?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Well, why don’t you address it, or else let
me have the desk?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen</span> <span class="dr">(rising)</span>. You may have it, Evvie. I’ll wait.
<span class="dr">(<span class="ch">Evelyn</span> seats herself, toys with pen.)</span> Well, why don’t
you do it, if you’re in such a rush? <span class="dr">(<span class="ch">Evelyn</span> laughs.)</span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> For the same reason you don’t, I guess.
Here! <span class="dr">(Hands her a fountain pen.)</span> You can do yours
on the table. Then we won’t bother each other.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> I’ll let you see who mine is addressed to, if
you will, too.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> No, thanks. <span class="dr">(Both hesitate, laugh, and
<span class="ch">Helen</span> takes hers to table. Both write hastily. A crash
is heard, followed by a loud scream, and both girls rush
out. <span class="ch">Bobby</span> comes out of his hiding-place, and changes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
valentines swiftly, sealing both, then darts back as he
hears girls coming. They enter.)</span> Katy will scare us to
death some day. Did you ever see any one who could
get so many tumbles?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Or smash so many dishes? No, I never did.
<span class="dr">(Takes up valentine.)</span> Why, I don’t remember sealing
this.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Nor I mine. I suppose the&mdash;the Irish
earthquake in an American kitchen put it out of our
heads. Want me to mail your letter? I’m going out.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> No, thanks. I’m going out, too, and this
envelope is private property.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> H’m! I could make a pretty good guess as
to the name on the outside. It’s “Pet,” of course.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Really, it’s mean to call Phil that. He hates
it so!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Then his mamma shouldn’t have named him
Philip Etheridge, when she knew his last name must always
be Tuttle. Then he is such a pet. I always want
to see a big lawn bonnet on those golden curls of his, and
see his dear little self in ruffled white dresses, with short
socks and blue slippers. Of course the little darling
wants a valentine! But I should think he’d make you
tired!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> He’s lots nicer than that homely Jack Hamilton.
All he thinks of is baseball.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Well, he isn’t soft and sentimental, and&mdash;mushy
like Pet. I don’t care to lead a nice little poodle-dog
around by a blue ribbon.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> You’d prefer a bulldog?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> I certainly should. Coming out to mail your
precious epistle?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> I am.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Come on, then. <span class="dr">(Both pass out.)</span></p>

chance. No, here comes Lou!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

to?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Nobody. I’m sending valentines.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Valentines? More than one? Helen and
Evvie only sent one apiece, and I’m going to send one.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Oh, Bobby, who to?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> That ain’t good grammar.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Who you sending ’em to, Lou?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> I shan’t tell. Go ’way, Bobby, so’s I can

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Tell me who they’re going to?</p>

Louie.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> What you want to know for? To tell somebody,
and get me laughed at?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> No, I won’t tell, honest Injun!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Well, the pretty one goes to Reginald, and
the homely one goes to Freddie, ’cause I’m mad on him!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> What you mad at Freddie for?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> ’Cause he said Valentine’s Day was silly, and
he shouldn’t send one.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Ho, ho! And you wanted him to send you
one!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> No such thing! He can keep his old valentines,
if he wants to. I’m going to send a lovely one to
Reginald. He’s got sense enough to ’preciate it, maybe.
And I got a horrid comic one of a miser, all ragged and
thin, gnawing a bare bone, like a dog, with his money all
piled up around him.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Mamma doesn’t like us to send comic ones.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Don’t you tell, Bobby Winston!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> What’ll you give me not to? My aggie back
again?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> I haven’t got it yet to give back again. Yes,
keep it if you want to, but don’t tell. If you do, I’ll never
tell you anything again, so there, now!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Well, I won’t, but Mamma wouldn’t like it.
You know she wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Maybe she wouldn’t like all you’ve been up
to, either, Sir Robert.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> What you know about what I’ve been up to?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Oh, you have! You have been up to some
mischief! Now if you tell, I will.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> You can’t, for you don’t know it to tell,
smarty. Say, Lou, let’s see the funny one.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> It isn’t funny. It’s just horrid, and I meant
it to be. Besides, they’re sealed now. Keep still while
I direct them. <span class="dr">(She writes. <span class="ch">Bobby</span> gets behind her, and
shows wild enjoyment. <span class="ch">Louise</span> rises.)</span> There! Now
I’ll go mail ’em. Have you sent any, Bobby?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Not me. I’ve got too many sisters to want
to send valentines to girls. <span class="dr">(<span class="ch">Louise</span> goes out. <span class="ch">Bobby</span>
seats himself at desk.)</span> See if I can get mine sent some
time to-day. <span class="dr">(Writes.)</span> I suppose I’d better mail the
one Bert forgot. Gee! But wasn’t it good! Louise
mixed up her own, and she’s sent the pretty one to Fred,
and the other to Reginald. Good one on her! It seems
to be catching. I’ll go out and mail mine before anything
happens to it. It’s a poor day for valentines. Sort of
mixy, somehow. Six of ’em, all going wrong! Gee!
Mine’s the lucky seventh. Wish I was a bumblebee, and
could follow some of ’em. Wouldn’t it be fun! Well,
Papa says a boy ought to be a good mixer. Guess I’m
all right. <span class="dr">(Goes to door, and calls.)</span> Mamma!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> <span class="dr">(outside)</span>. What is it, Bobby?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby</span> <span class="dr">(as she enters)</span>. Here’s a letter Bert left on
the desk, all addressed and sealed. Shall I mail it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Certainly. Let me see it, Bobby. <span class="dr">(Takes
it, and reads.)</span> It’s for Eloise. A valentine, probably.
Mail it by all means, dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> The paper, probably.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Yes, but something more.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> A letter.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Something better and more precious still.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> What was it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> A valentine&mdash;such a pretty one! Why, I
haven’t had a valentine for years!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Did you like it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> I certainly did, very much. If I only knew

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> You did?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Yes indeed. Thank you so much, dear.
It was very nice to receive a valentine once more.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Don’t ladies get valentines?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Not usually after they are my age, dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> But Miss Colwell does, and I heard you say
once that you had the same birthday.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> So we have, dear, but what makes you think
she gets valentines?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> I know she does. Uncle Bertram sent her
one this morning, and he said it was the fortieth.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Uncle Bertram? Did he tell you that,
Bobby?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> N-no, not exactly; but he said it, Mamma.
He did, really.</p>

you come to hear it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

you have told me, Bobby. Not to any one. Remember.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Gee! That’s a beaut of Reginald’s. Bet
you’re glad you sent him one.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> No, I’m not. He bought one for every girl
in our class&mdash;every single girl! He likes to show off how
much pocket money he has.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> It’s a very pretty valentine, Louise.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise</span> <span class="dr">(showing last one)</span>. I like this better. Freddie
made it all himself, and it’s the only one he sent.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> ’Tis pretty, but it isn’t nearly so swell as
Reggie’s. Besides, I thought Freddie wasn’t going to
send any.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> He said he wasn’t going to buy any, and he
didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Gee! And you sent him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> I didn’t either, Bobby Winston. I got those

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> I hope my little daughter didn’t send a comic
valentine to any one.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> I did, Mamma, but I shan’t again. I should
have been so ashamed if Freddie had got it, when he
made me such a pretty one.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> But how about Reginald?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Oh, Reggie didn’t care a bit. He never got
a comic one before, and he thought it was funny. He
never guessed one of us girls sent it, and you see, it was
a miser, and Reggie isn’t a bit, you know, so it didn’t
touch him at all, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

Worse than April first!</p>

up?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Evelyn! What sort of talk is that?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Well, I’m sick of her nagging! And everything’s
gone wrong to-day.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> I don’t see as anything went wrong with you.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> I suppose you wouldn’t call it so, but why
any one should want that simp of a Pet hanging round
her, I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Then why did you have him?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> How could I help it? He doesn’t know
enough to see when he’s turned down. I did everything
but slap his pretty face for him, but nothing would penetrate
that rhinoceros hide of self-esteem. Bah! He
makes me sick!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> You looked like it. I saw how earnestly you
were talking to him.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> I certainly was.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Gee! Evvie’s stole Helen’s beau, and Helen’s
mad!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> No such thing.</p>

signs of Evelyn’s fancying Philip. He isn’t her style.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> No, he isn’t. I detest sissy boys, and always
did. Helen can have him and welcome.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Then why did you send him a valentine? No

neither of my girls is going to forget that she is a lady.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Well, she did send him one.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> I did not!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> I heard him thank you for it in two lines of
poetry.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> And if you’d played eavesdropper a little
longer, you’d have heard me absolutely deny it. I told
him I only sent one, and that not to him, and advised him
to talk to the one to whom he sent the volume of poetry
and the white roses.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> And he said you were the prettiest. I hate
you both, so there!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Truly, Helen&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Don’t talk to me. I saw the address on the
envelope, and so did Freda and Myrtle, and we all recognized
your writing. No other girl in school makes a P
like yours.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> It was a very good imitation, I’ll admit.
The work, no doubt, of some one who thought it a very
good joke to play on me. Just wait till I see Mr. Jack
Hamilton, that’s all. It was a neat little stroke of business
to be out of town to-day. I could shake him with
a will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> But why should a valentine make such a
disturbance? It’s just boy and girl fun at your age.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Helen don’t think so. She’s awful spoony on
Mr. Philip Etheridge Tuttle.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> That will do, Bobby. Don’t be vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Well, he always walks to the corner with her,
and to-night he didn’t. He came with Evvie.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Came after her, you mean, trotting behind
like a little poodle-dog whose missis goes too fast for him,
and she and Helen have been fighting ever since.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Well, she knew he liked me, and she’s always
pretended not to like him, and he’s always thought she
was pretty, and so, when she sent him the valentine&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> When she sent him nothing! If he tags me
to-morrow I’ll tie a blue ribbon on his neck, and hitch it
to a little chain, and lead him round like a nice little toy
dog. You see if I don’t!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Just to show every girl in the school that
you’ve captured him! Well, I’ll see that they know how
you did it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> I’m about tired of being told I&mdash;twist the
truth.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> I’d say it stronger, if Mother’d let me. You
may think it, instead. I saw you address that envelope
this morning, and you refused to let me see the name&mdash;you
know you did!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Well, so did you. What was the matter
with the one you sent him, I wonder?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> I wish I’d never sent it. All I’ve got from
him to-day at school is a nod and a stare. He’s mad
about something, and you’re to blame.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> How about the roses and the book?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Well&mdash;he sent them before he got Evvie’s
valentine.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> I never sent him any!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> That will do, girls, both of you. Helen, if
things have gone to this point I am glad I have found it
out in time. I knew he was a rather sentimental boy, but
I thought him harmless as an associate, and he was poor
Fanny’s boy, so I have encouraged his coming here&mdash;having
no mother. But this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Oh, Helen isn’t quite as foolish as she seems,
Mamma. She’s just jealous because he thinks me pretty.
As if I cared what he thought!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen</span> <span class="dr">(sneeringly)</span>. Yes, as if you did!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Here’s Bert coming. If you don’t want to

better stop it. Bobby and Louise, not a word about it.

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> To me? Say, Uncle, is it a joke, or have you
gone nutty, or what? I haven’t seen you since morning.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> No, I know it, but you’ve done a great
thing for me, just the same. I’m&mdash;I’m going to be married.</p>

<p><span class="ch">All</span> <span class="dr">(together)</span>. Why, Bertram! Oh, Uncle Bertram!
Who to? Why, Uncle!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Glad to hear it, I’m sure, but I don’t see what
I had to do with it. I didn’t propose to the lady for you,
I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> That’s just what you did, boy, though you
didn’t know it. And she wore the white rose, all right.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Oh, she did? Well, I don’t know how you
came to know of it, but if Eloise wants to marry a man
twice her age because he has a little money, she’s welcome,
for all me. I&mdash;I congratulate you, Uncle Bertram.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Good grit, boy, though it isn’t true, one
bit of it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> What isn’t? Aren’t you going to be married?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> I certainly am, and so is Eloise, I fancy;
but not together. I’m to marry Miss Ellen Colwell, my
boy.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Ellen? After all these years?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Not Eloise? But the rose?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> And how did Bert propose for you, when he
didn’t know anything about it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Do keep still, everybody, and let Uncle Bertram
tell it. It sounds awfully mixed up to me.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Yes, explain, do, Uncle. You’ve got me guessing
for fair.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Well, you see, to really explain, I’d have
to go back twenty years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Oh, do, Uncle. It sounds so romantic.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Romantic! Idiotic! That’s what it was!
Well, you see, when I was a youngster only three years
old, Dr. Colwell came to town to practice, and bought the
home where Miss Ellen lives now. We lived on the same
street then, and Mother took me with her when she went
to call, and I fell in love with her on the spot.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> With your mother, or the doctor?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> With the doctor’s baby, little Ellen. She
was a bit of a thing, with a white dress and a blue sash,
and blue shoes, and she had big blue eyes that just
matched, and little soft, yellow curls, and she called me
“Boy.” It was the first word she had ever tried to say,
her mother told me.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Miss Ellen’s hair is brown.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> So it is, Louie, but it used to be yellow.
Well, from that day on we were playmates, and I sent
her a valentine that year. In fact, I have every year. I
sent my fortieth this morning.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> But I don’t see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Hold on, Namesake. Wait a bit, and you
will. Twenty years ago I sent one in which, in the best
verses I knew how to make, I asked her a question&mdash;<em>the</em>
question; and I asked her, if the answer was yes, to wear
a white rose in her hair, and to sit in the bay window as I
went home that night.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Yes, I know, my boy. We’re much alike,
and history repeats itself. If it hadn’t&mdash;well, to go on,
she didn’t do it, although I had had some white roses
delivered there that afternoon. It seems now that she
didn’t get the valentine at all. It went astray somehow.
She thought I had forgotten, and didn’t care, and I
thought the answer was “no,” and it made a difference
in our friendship. Though we have been friends, the
old intimacy was gone&mdash;and&mdash;well, we’ve lost twenty
years.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Oh, brother!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> We’re going to make them up, Eva, don’t
you forget it. Well, to-day I sent my fortieth valentine,
and the same thing happened. It went astray. At least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
she hasn’t got it yet. <span class="dr">(<span class="ch">Bobby</span> gives a start, and claps his
hand to his pocket, but no one seems to notice. <span class="ch">Uncle
B.</span> goes on.)</span> She did get one, though, in rhyme, which,
strange to say, asked her the selfsame thing. Don’t blush,
my boy! And as she always gets a box of white roses on
this particular day, when I came home to-night there she
sat, in the bay window, with a white rose in her hair! I
couldn’t believe my eyes, but I went in, and it’s all right.
We’re to be married in six weeks, and I’ve you to thank,
my boy, and when you and Eloise are married, you’ll get
a check for one thousand dollars for a wedding present.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> But I don’t see how she came to get my letter,
and I should have thought she would have known it
wasn’t hers.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Why, you called her Ellie&mdash;my old pet
name for her, as well as yours for Eloise, it seems, and
you signed it Bert, which every one always called me till
I had a namesake nephew.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> But I directed mine all right, and&mdash;no, I didn’t
mail it, I do believe. I went off in a rush with Frank,
and left it on the desk.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> And Bobby found it there, and I told him to
mail it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> And did you mail it, Bobby?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> He didn’t! He forgot it. I saw him start
just now, and clap his hand to his pocket. I bet it’s there
now.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Can’t be, because Ellen got it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert</span> <span class="dr">(rising, and grasping <span class="ch">Bobby</span>, who is trying to
sneak away)</span>. Come here, my beloved little brother.
Let’s see what you have in your pocket.</p>

to go through his pockets, in spite of his endeavors

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> You let me go.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Directly, my dear brother, directly. Ah, here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
we are! <span class="dr">(He takes letter from <span class="ch">Bobby’s</span> pocket.)</span> That’s
my letter, sure. Now, young man, why didn’t you mail
it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> I meant to, truly. But I forgot.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Let Uncle Bertram open it, Bert. I’ll bet a
box of candy <em>his</em> valentine is inside. There have been
queer doings with valentines to-day, and I believe Bobby’s
at the bottom of the whole thing. Hold him tight while
I investigate, or rather while we all do. Open that,
Uncle Bert.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert</span> <span class="dr">(passing it)</span>. Yes, do, Uncle Bert. My letter
isn’t inside, that’s sure, since Miss Ellen got it. No, no,
Sir Robert, stay right here. Your elder brother is very
fond of your company just now.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Let go! You’re twisting my arm!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> I won’t hurt as long as you don’t try to get
away, but here you’ve got to stay just now. How about
it, Uncle?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> <span class="dr">(who has opened letter and looked inside)</span>.
It’s mine, all right, boy. <span class="dr">(To <span class="ch">Bobby</span>.)</span> Now, young
man, how about it? Who changed them around, and
when?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> How should I know? I found this on the
desk and asked Mamma if I should mail it, and she said
yes, and then I forgot to, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> But how came Uncle Bertram’s letter in this
envelope?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> How should I know? Stop that! Mamma,
he’s hurting me.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Yes? Well, I should advise him to keep on
doing so till he gets to the bottom of the mystery.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Yes, make him tell. I’ll bet he did it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Might as well own up, Bobby. You’ll have
to in the end.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> There wasn’t any letter on the desk when I
wrote mine. Oh, Bobby, did you change mine? If you
did, I’m glad, Bobby, truly I am.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> I didn’t though, truly, Lou. You did it yourself.
I knew it, though, but I thought I’d keep still. I
wanted to find out if Reggie Westcott could get mad.
He’s such a girlie boy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> Well, he didn’t. But I’m glad Freddie didn’t
get it. I’m glad they got mixed.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> So am I, girlie. ’Twas a good mix up for
me, but I’m sure other hands tampered with mine.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> And mine. Now, young man, how about it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> About what?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert</span> <span class="dr">(taking him across knee)</span>. About this.</p>

<div class="direction">

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Ow! You hurt.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Good. I’m going to make each one a little
harder than the last. Will you tell me how and when
you changed those letters? No answer? Very well.</p>

<div class="direction">

<div class="dr">

<p>(Spanks again.)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Mamma, make him stop.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Not until you tell the truth about it, Bobby.
A joke is a joke, but a lie is a lie, and I’m certain you do
know. Answer truly, now. Don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert</span> <span class="dr">(spanking again)</span>. Answer your mother, young
man.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Gee! How can I answer when you’re hurting
me?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert</span> <span class="dr">(standing him between knees again)</span>. Now I’m
not hurting you. Answer Mother.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Answer what? Oh, don’t take me that way
again. I’ll answer. Yes, Mamma, I do know. I only
did it for fun. Bert left his when he went off in a hurry,
and I was going to look at it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> Well, that’s cool.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> I just wanted to see if it was as pretty as the
one I had for Mamma, and Uncle Bert came in quick,
and I didn’t want him to catch me looking at it, so I
dodged behind the portière. And he talked out loud to
himself, and said it was the fortieth one he’d sent her,
and I just thought thirty-nine was enough to get from
one man, and I wished I could get a chance to change
’em, just for fun, so when Uncle Bert was called to the
’phone&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> So that’s when you did it! I thought I
hadn’t sealed that envelope!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> So I slipped yours out, and Bert’s in, and
sealed it, and dodged back. Then I fixed the other back
there. They weren’t valentines, though, either of ’em&mdash;just
poetry, with a fancy border, but both of ’em begun
“Dearest Ellie,” and ended “Yours forever, Bert,” so I
don’t see why one wasn’t as good as the other. Bert’s
was the best, though, really, ’cause any one could understand
it, but yours was just rhymes and long words, without
any sense that I could see.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> You little scamp! Don’t you know it’s dishonorable
to read other folks’ letters?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> They weren’t letters. They were valentines.
How was I to know that men were so silly as to write
letters that way? When I want to get married I shall
just walk up to the one I want and tell her so.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> Right you are, Bobby. If I’d done so, I’d
have been a married man all these years, instead of a
lonely old bach.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bert.</span> I believe he’s right myself. I’m off to try my
luck. If she says “No,” the whole family will know I’m
jilted, thanks to my small brother. Wish me good luck,
mother mine.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> Indeed I do, my boy. Never fear. If I
have read Eloise’s eyes aright lately, we’ll congratulate
you in the morning.</p>

little deeper. If you don’t answer <em>my</em> questions, I shall
tickle you without mercy. You were behind there when
Helen and I came in?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Stop, Evvie, do stop. Yes, I was there.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> And you changed them when Katy fell, and
we ran to the kitchen?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> Yes. I knew how you hated Pet, and I
thought it would be funny to make you send him a valentine.
So, of course, I had to send Helen’s to Jack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Of all the mean kids!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> You see, Helen, I wasn’t as mean or as silly
as you thought, or as Phil thought, either. You may explain
to him if you choose.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Helen.</span> Well, I shan’t. Any one as fickle as that
isn’t worth it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> I’m glad you see it, little daughter. I really
think that, as so much good has resulted from Bobby’s
playing Cupid, we will have to forgive him this time, but
he must never do so again.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> I won’t, Mamma, truly I won’t.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> I don’t suppose you ought to be paid for a
naughty trick, but that pony you’ve wanted so long is
yours, my boy, next Saturday.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Mrs. W.</span> No, not for a month, Bertram. Bobby must
be taught a lesson.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Bobby.</span> All right, Mamma. I deserve it. But thank
you, Uncle Bert. You’re a brick!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> And now, little girlie, what do you want?
A pony, too, or a big dolly?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> I want to be the little flower girl.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Uncle B.</span> So you shall, bless your heart! And
Helen and Evelyn shall be bridesmaids.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Louise.</span> And maybe Eloise’ll let me be hers. I’ll be
two flower girls.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Evelyn.</span> Two weddings! And one twenty years delayed!
Well, I guess there’s something doing in this
family, and all because of Bobby and the changed valentines!</p>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

<p class="scene">SCENE.&mdash;<i>A plain, old-fashioned room. The essential
piece of furniture is an old-fashioned sewing table,
what is known as a Martha Washington table, and is
quite generally imitated to-day. They were small and
square, with leaves that turned down, and two drawers.</i></p>

<div class="direction">

<div class="dr">

<p>(<span class="ch">Great-Aunt Polly</span> is seated by the table, looking at
a collection of valentines, post-cards, etc., such as the
young girl of to-day receives. <span class="ch">Pauline</span> is seated a
little way from her.)</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Very pretty, Pauline, I’m sure, and a great
many of them for one little schoolgirl. I don’t really like
the post-cards, though, dearie. It doesn’t seem just right
to send a valentine unenclosed.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Oh, it’s quite the thing, now, Aunt Polly.
Everybody does it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> It’s a style I do not care for, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> But it saves money.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> The difference between one cent and two is
not very wide, is it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> No, but when one wants to send a lot it
means a good deal, unless you are flush&mdash;and I never am.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Send a lot? What do you mean, my dear?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Why, every fellow wants to send one to
every pretty girl he knows, of course.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> A Christmas card, perhaps, but a valentine!
That should be for one only, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> How odd! Why, I sent twenty-five, myself,
to the nice boys I knew.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Twenty-five! Oh, my dear! You didn’t!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Sure I did! Why not? Is that the way
they sent them in your day, Auntie? Seems to me they
were rather narrow.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> No, indeed, my dear, but a valentine meant
something then. A young man sent but one, and that
went to the lady of his choice. The girls did not send
any. We would have thought it immodest. But girls
do many things to-day that would not have been tolerated
in my day. A girl, then, was supposed to be a lady.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Instead of a madcap tomboy? Well, I
plead guilty, and throw myself on the mercy of the court.
I just love to be a tomboy, and I’m going to be one a long
time yet. No “one valentine” sentiment for me, or one
boy, either, for years to come.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Well, perhaps you are right, yet many of
my girlhood friends married at sixteen, and nearly all of
them were married by the time they were twenty, that
is, of course, those who married at all.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> And why didn’t you, Auntie dear? Didn’t
you ever like any one well enough?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Yes, dearie, I did. I don’t suppose any
woman lives to be thirty without liking some one well
enough to marry him, if circumstances came about right.
But there! They don’t always do it. Would you like
to see my old valentines, Pauline?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Oh, I would, so much, Auntie dear!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> <span class="dr">(opening top drawer of stand)</span>. Well,
dearie, here they are. No post-cards among them.
Most of them came from the same one, as you see.
This is the last one he ever sent me.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline</span> <span class="dr">(opening it.)</span> Did he die, Auntie?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> No, he didn’t die, dear. He’s alive still.
He got angry at me, that’s all. Talk of girls getting in a
huff over nothing! Boys aren’t far behind, let me tell
you.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> And did he marry?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> No, he is single still.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Then he cared, you see. How romantic!
Why didn’t you try to make up with him?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> It isn’t the lady’s place, my dear, to run
after a man.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Well, I like that! Well, if ever I’m fond
of a man, I’ll run after him and hold him, if necessary,
till I know what he was mad at. Or did you know,
Auntie? And was it something that couldn’t be made up?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Why, I suppose I did know, dearie&mdash;but it
seemed such a slight thing to anger him. My cousin
came that Valentine’s Day. We had been brought up
almost like brother and sister before I came to this town.
It was fine sleighing, and he took me over to Wrentham
for the night. His mother was there, just for the day
and night, and the young girl whom he was to marry.
When I came home, next day, I asked my mother for my
mail. She replied that there wasn’t any. “But there
must have been a valentine,” I said. “Amos always
sends me one.” “I know,” she answered, “but this year
he didn’t. He called, though, last evening, and seemed
much put out that you were not here. He went off as
stiff as a poker.” Of course, I thought he must be angry
because I went sleighing with Timothy, though I thought
it a bit far-fetched, as we were only old friends, and so
were Timothy and myself. “But,” I thought, “I’ll explain
when he gets over his huff, and it will be all right.”</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> And didn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> No, dear, I hadn’t the opportunity. Next
day his mother came over to tell us that he had gone
away. She seemed to think I was to blame, somehow,
and she never was nice to me again, and it was more
than a year before Amos came back, and then he was
just coldly polite when we met. That was the end of my
little romance, dear, for though there were others who
found me fair, somehow I couldn’t seem to care for any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of them. You see, dearie, Amos had won my love,
though he didn’t know it, and so&mdash;&mdash; <span class="dr">(Pauses.)</span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> And he has it yet! Oh, Auntie, how
romantic! And does he live in town still?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Yes, but I meet him seldom, and we merely
say a “How-de-do” in passing. Excuse me, dearie. I
think I will go up-stairs a few minutes, while you look at
my old keepsakes. I cannot imagine how I came to let
you wheedle this old story from me. Please do not refer
to it again.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> No indeed, Auntie. Thank you for telling
me. <span class="dr">(<span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> passes out, and <span class="ch">Pauline</span> proceeds to
investigate drawer, soliloquizing as she does so.)</span> Such
quaint little valentines! I like them, though! And
nearly all in the same handwriting&mdash;that of the faithless
Amos, evidently. Yes, this one is signed A. H. A. H.
A is Amos, of course. A. H. Could it be Mr. Hill, I
wonder? “A. Hill,” he has it on his sign. He’s old, or
rather old&mdash;sixty, I shouldn’t wonder, and he’s a
bachelor. I’ll bet he’s the one! Mean old thing, to
bring tears to the eyes of my little great-auntie after all
these years! <span class="dr">(Puts valentines hack in drawer, and shuts
it rather vigorously, letting one drop, unnoticed, to the
floor.)</span> Men and boys are queer creatures, anyhow.
I’m glad I’m a girl! And I’m glad I live now, instead
of forty years ago. Why, I got more valentines, I do believe,
to-day, than Aunt Polly has in all her life. Why,
I dropped one! <span class="dr">(Picks it up.)</span> Amos was a little fellow
when he sent this, I guess. <span class="dr">(Opens it.)</span> No, this is
from the Timothy who seems to have been the villain in
the little pastoral comedy. What a cute little verse!</p>

down! And here&mdash;why, I do believe here’s another
valentine from Amos that was never opened. It is sealed
and addressed, but I don’t believe she ever got it. And
that, I’ll bet, made the trouble! I wonder&mdash;yes, I will,
I’ll mail it and see what comes of it. I’ll call Auntie, first,
and show her the drawer. No, on second thoughts, I
won’t hurry about that. Here’s to mail Amos’ last valentine,
and then I’ll run down to the office later, when the
afternoon mail comes in, and get it. Wouldn’t it be

forget you. <span class="dr">(Does not close drawer, but looks up as
knock is heard.)</span> Eh? What? Come in, whoever you
are. <span class="dr">(<span class="ch">Pauline</span> enters.)</span> Polly! <span class="dr">(Gazes in surprise at
her.)</span> Who in the world are you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Oh, I’m Polly, just as you said, though
most folks call me Pauline.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> But who are you? I thought&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> You thought I was Aunt Polly? Do I
look like her?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Is Miss Polly Dennison your aunt?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> My great-aunt.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Then you’re Angie Dennison’s girl?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Yes, I’m Pauline Waldron, and I’m visiting
at Aunt Polly’s.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> But what brings you here?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I’m playing Cupid. <span class="dr">(Catches sight of picture.)</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Oh, is that Aunt Polly? What a dear, old-fashioned
little girl! May I see it closer?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos</span> <span class="dr">(passing it rather reluctantly)</span>. Won’t you sit
down?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline</span> <span class="dr">(seating herself)</span>. What a sweet little face!
How old was she?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Eight, I believe!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> What beautiful wavy hair! And so long!
But what a narrow ribbon she had on top!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Yes, little girls didn’t have more ribbon than
hair in those days. She had fine eyes, too.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Yes, and has yet. But what a queer little
dress, with its plaited trimmings, and a lace bib! And
the sash is wide enough to make up for the hair ribbon,
I’m sure. Oh, do give it to me!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos</span> <span class="dr">(taking it hastily)</span>. Certainly not. It’s a keep-sake.
And now, my young lady, you will oblige me by
forgetting that you have seen it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Oh, I couldn’t forget it, it’s so quaint and
dear!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I don’t see as it is so quaint. A dainty little
girl, in a very pretty frock, I think. Much prettier than
little girls wear nowadays. Please forget it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> You shouldn’t use slang, Mr. Hill.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I didn’t, I assure you. I only implore that
you will not mention having seen what was never intended
for your eyes.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I won’t, indeed. You liked Aunt Polly,
then?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Certainly. We were playmates and schoolmates
from that time on. That was taken just after she
came to this town. You look very like her at your age,
my dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> So much so that you called me Polly.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Did I? Excuse me. And now, my dear little
girl&mdash;I mean young lady, what can I do for you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Just answer a few questions. This is Valentine’s
Day; you know, and I’ve been playing Cupid.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Indeed? And what did you wish to ask me?
If it was ever legal to play Cupid, I think it is on Valentine’s
Day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> If&mdash;if any one finds a letter that was evidently
intended to be mailed, and it hasn’t been, is it right
for that person to mail it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Why, certainly. It’s the proper thing to do,
my dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Even if it has been lost a long time?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I should think so. You see, you have no right
to open it, so you would not know the writer, and thus
could not return it to him, so the only thing to do is to
mail it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> So I thought. But you see, this one has
been lost for forty years.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Forty years? Are you sure? Perhaps the
one to whom it was addressed has moved, or is dead. It
is a long time, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> No, he hasn’t, and she isn’t, so I mailed it.
But I think I know the writer. Ought I to tell him about
it, too?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Why, it might be well to do so. It is an unusual
occurrence, to get a letter that was written to one
forty years ago. I think you had better tell me the whole
story.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I believe I will. I was showing my valentines
to Auntie to-day. Oh, do you know, I believe that
letter was a valentine. Did you ever lose one?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Never. A valentine forty years old will be
rather stale, I fear. Perhaps the lady&mdash;I believe you said
it was a lady&mdash;may have been married for years to some
other man. She may be a grandmother now, and may
laugh at the effusion of the callow youth of the olden
time.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> She won’t, I’m sure. And she isn’t a
grandmother, for she never married. She has been faithful
to a faithless lover all these years, and I believe that
lost valentine is at the bottom of the whole trouble.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Indeed, just how, may I ask?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Why, he had always sent her one, every
year, since they were children, but that year he was mad
about something, and he didn’t send her any. That is,
she has always thought he didn’t, but I believe he did, and
that that’s the letter I found to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> And where did you find a letter forty years
old, that had never been mailed? It may cause strange
misunderstandings now, child. Perhaps it would have
been better to have asked my advice before you mailed it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I’m asking it now. Mr. Hill, did you send
Aunt Polly a valentine forty years ago? Think back
carefully, and see if you can remember.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I can remember quite distinctly, my dear. I
did send your aunt one that day&mdash;the last one I ever sent
her. I have reason to remember it quite plainly, my dear,
on account of the answer I received.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> The answer? But you couldn’t have got
any answer, for she thinks the last one you sent her was
forty-one years ago. She never got that other one, so
how could she answer it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I certainly thought she did, and negatively, at
that. But&mdash;my dear, do you mean that you think you
have found that letter&mdash;that valentine, which I never
knew had been lost? Where, and how?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Why, Auntie let me see her old valentines,
and when I’d put them away, I found I had dropped one.
And the drawer stuck when I tried to open it, and I
jerked it, and somehow knocked down a little drawer
that must have been above it, and in it lay the letter I
told you of. It was addressed to Aunt Polly, and sealed,
and had a three-cent stamp on it, but it had never been
opened.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Because she didn’t care to open it, my dear.
I happen to know that she got it, for her grandmother
took it from my hand that morning, and said she would
give it into her own hand. And you see, she must have
had it, for it was in her own secret drawer.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I don’t think she knew about the drawer.
And I know she didn’t get it, for she told me so to-day,
and her eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Polly cried?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Yes. She loved you, I’m sure, and thought
you were angry with her because she went over to Wrentham
with her cousin.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> With Tim! Good land, child, I shouldn’t have
been jealous of Tim! But why didn’t she explain?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Good gracious! If she didn’t get it, there was nothing
to explain!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> And you went away next day, and she
didn’t see you for a year.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Yes, but&mdash;oh, what a hopeless, foolish tangle!
And you mailed that letter, child? Has she got it yet?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> No, I shall go to the office before I go
back. Oh, I believe she was going to the milliner’s this
afternoon, so probably she’ll get it herself.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> And she’ll read it&mdash;for the first time&mdash;after
forty years! See here, little girl, I’ll be over to-night
for the answer, but don’t you tell her I’m coming.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> But you never go there.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I did once, and I’m coming again. To-night,
you understand, and I want you to give me a clear coast
for half an hour or so, will you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Of course.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Maybe I’m an old fool for my pains, but that
letter asked her a question&mdash;<em>the</em> question, and told her I
would come that evening for my answer, and I’m coming.
If she gets it to-day, to-night is the night to call, and I’m
coming, if I get turned down for my pains. I thought
she went away to get out of having to say no. And to
think I wasted forty years! Well, there’s no fool like an
old fool, and Polly’s got to answer that question. Wish
me luck, little girl.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Indeed I do! And Aunt Polly does care,
I know. I’m glad I meddled.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> So am I. Though I can’t understand about
that letter. Going? Well, you look in the office this
evening, and you’ll find the finest valentine this town
affords, addressed to Cupid. Good-afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Good-afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I didn’t know you were ever nervous,
Auntie.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Hadn’t you better go to bed, Auntie, and

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Yes, my dear, it is disturbing news, really.
It’s almost as if some one had risen from the dead; and
I don’t understand it, and I don’t know what to do or
say.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Could I help you any, Auntie dear?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> No, I think not, dearie. I must think it out

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Oh, don’t, dear, don’t. Stay with me.
Some one might come in.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Are you expecting any one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> N-no, not exactly. That is&mdash;no, of course
not.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Why, Auntie dear, if you were a young
girl, I should say you were expecting a visit from your
young man.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But as I’m not, but an old woman of fifty-eight,
you know it can’t be any nonsense of that sort.
Remember, my dear Pauline, I am your great-aunt.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Not so very great, either; just the dearest
little auntie in the world. And you don’t seem a bit old.
Why, your hair isn’t hardly a bit gray. Besides, there
was Mrs. Atherton, in our home town, was married just
before I came here, and she was sixty-three.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> She was a widow, dear.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> What difference did that make? They
said that Mr. Buffinton was her first lover, but that her
father had separated them, and every one was glad to
see her married.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Very nice and romantic, dear, but, as I said
before, she was a widow, and that makes a great deal of
difference. If she had been a maiden lady, every one
would have called her silly, and laughed at her.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I don’t see why.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Nor I, dear, truly, but the fact remains that
they do. It would take quite a strong-minded woman to
face it. I couldn’t, I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I’ll tell you how I’m going to do. I’m going
to have an answer to that letter.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> What letter? Do sit down, Amos! You
make me nervous.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos</span> <span class="dr">(seating himself)</span>. Well, I’ve sat down. Now
how about the answer to that letter?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> That letter?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Yes, that letter. It’s no use to fence for time,
Polly. I’m going to have an answer. Didn’t you get a
valentine letter from me to-day?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Amos, you never sent that letter to-day.
It was old. It looked old, and it had a three-cent stamp.
Three-cent stamps have been out of use thirty years and
more.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Then you did get it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Yes, but I don’t understand it, and I’m all
upset about it. It was like a voice from the dead.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> It was, Polly, a voice from the dead past.
That letter should have reached you forty years ago.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Did you write that forty years ago, Amos?
And why didn’t you send it? Why send it now, after all
these years?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I did send it, dear heart. There’s a mystery
about that letter that we will talk about later. Just now
I want my answer.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Your answer, now?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Yes, now. Polly, dear, I’ve waited forty years
for my answer. Isn’t that long enough to keep a man
waiting?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But, Amos, forty years changes things.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> It hasn’t changed my love for you any. I’ve
tried to down it for forty years because I thought I’d got
my answer. But have that answer I must and will.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But, Amos&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Let’s go back a bit, Polly. You used to like
me when we were little playmates, now didn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Yes, of course. You were the nicest boy
I knew.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> And when we went to the old Academy together.
You liked me then?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Why, yes, of course, Amos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> And if you’d got that letter when you were
meant to get it, you’d have said yes; now, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> You would, Polly, now wouldn’t you? Come,
own up; it’s forty years past.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Why, yes.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Then you’ll say it now. You’ve just got it,
and I’ve come for my answer, as I said I should. Isn’t
it yes, Polly dearest?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But, Amos, I’m an old woman now.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> And I’m an old man. I’m sixty.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> I’m sure that isn’t old! For a man, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Then fifty-eight isn’t old&mdash;for a woman.
Polly, I’ve everything but the thing I want most. I’ve
no real home. I’m lonesome, dear. I’ve been lonesome
for forty years&mdash;forty years that the locusts have eaten.
Must I always be lonely, Polly?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But think what people would say, Amos.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I don’t care what people say, Polly. I only
care for you, and to know that you care. And you do
care, Polly, I know. Else why have you kept single all
these years? Besides, if you didn’t care, you’d have said
no and you haven’t said it. You’ve fenced. Polly, you
did care. Don’t you care any longer? Tell me!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Y-yes, Amos, I did care.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> And you’ve got over it? You no longer care?
Ah, you can’t say no. Say yes, Polly. Forty years is a
long while to wait for an answer.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> That’s it, Amos, those forty years. It looks
so ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Ridiculous, nothing! I’m waiting to hear that
yes, Polly. And I shan’t go home till I hear it.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Well&mdash;yes, then.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Oh, Polly, my girl, to think I didn’t hear that
forty years ago! We’ve lots of time to make up.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Pauline! Did you know?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Didn’t I tell you she was chief conspirator?
She brought it all about. You shall be bridesmaid, Polly
girl, and choose what you please for a gift.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> That will be lovely. When is it to be?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Soon.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Oh, no, not very soon.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Yes, soon, very soon. Good land, Polly, isn’t
forty years long enough?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But what had you to do with this, Pauline?
And where has that letter been all these years?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Why, you see, Auntie, when I put the old
valentines away I dropped one, and when I tried to open
the drawer it stuck. I jerked it hard, to open it, and
when it opened&mdash;&mdash; <span class="dr">(Opens drawer.)</span> Look! That’s
what I saw, and the letter was on top.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Why, how did that box come there? It
looks like a drawer.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos</span> <span class="dr">(pulling the drawer out, and looking in)</span>. It
was, Polly, a secret drawer, just above this one. Evidently
this had to be taken entirely out to reach it, but
one support has come loose, so it dropped into the other
drawer.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> <span class="dr">(taking secret drawer in her lap)</span>. I never
knew there was a secret drawer in this table. Why,
Amos! They’re Grandmother’s things! The ones we
never could find! Here’s her gold beads, and her gold
thimble, and Grandpa’s watch, and&mdash;this was Uncle
Robert’s little shoe&mdash;he died, you know, when he was a
year old&mdash;and this box is full of hair&mdash;Father’s curls, I
do believe! That’s all. No. <span class="dr">(Lifts paper in bottom of

there was a secret drawer in the desk, where she kept
money. She showed that to Father about a year before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
she died. But this&mdash;and how did my valentine get
there? How did Grandma get it before it was mailed?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> That’s plain enough. She ran in that morning
to show Mother a new patch-work pattern. The letter
lay on the desk, and she chaffed me about it. Then she
offered to play Cupid, and put it into your own hand.
Thinking you would get it earlier that way, I consented.
So when I called that night, and you were not at home, I
thought it was a kind way of saying no, and went away
to get over it. I couldn’t, though, and came back a year
later, as you know. But why your grandmother didn’t
give it to you, I don’t see. She was always a woman to
trust.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> I understand that part of it. When she
got home I had gone with Tim, and it was that night
she had a shock, Amos. She never spoke again, and died
a week later.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> And if I hadn’t run away on the first train
the next morning I would have known it, and might have
mistrusted that you didn’t get it! Oh, the years that the
locusts have eaten! That was one of her own expressions,
you remember.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But why didn’t you bring the letter to me,
Pauline, instead of to Amos?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I didn’t give it to either, Auntie. I mailed
it. If I’d given it to you, you’d have read it, and cried
over it, and treasured it, but you’d never have let&mdash;Uncle
Amos&mdash;see it or know of it, now would you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> Not at this late day. It would have been
equivalent to a proposal from me. But I would always
have treasured the thought that he did love me, after
all. That I had not given my love unsought, something
which has shamed me to myself all these years.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> And if I had given it to you, Mr. Hill&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Uncle Amos is good enough, Polly girl.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> If I had given it to you, Uncle Amos,
would you have mailed it?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> No, I should have thought it too late.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> So you see I did the best possible thing,
and the letter reached the right one, and the result is all
I hoped for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> But how did you know about it, Amos?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Oh, the mischievous Cupid came and told me
after she had mailed it, so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> So you thought I’d expect you?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> No, I didn’t. But the chance was too good to
let slide. I’d never had an answer after all, and I came
for it, as I said I would. I got it, too, just the answer I
wanted. ’Tisn’t every man who has to wait forty years
for his answer. And now, Pauline, what is the shortest
time required to rig up a wedding gown? A week?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> A week! The idea!</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> I’m talking to little Polly. Isn’t a week long
enough?</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> I think you’d better give her two.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Amos.</span> Two it is, then, and not a minute longer.
Order your rig out, little girl, the nicest and prettiest you
can find, and I’ll pay for it. You deserve it. And you’re
to be our adopted daughter, and spend every minute your
parents can spare you with us. We’ll have a motor,
childie, and anything else we want, and Polly and I will
do our best to make up the forty years we have lost.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Pauline.</span> Oh, I’m so glad I did it! I didn’t hardly
dare! It sounds like a romance.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Aunt P.</span> It is! To think of a lost valentine turning
up after forty years!</p>

<h3>COSTUMES</h3>

<p>Dress the <span class="ch">Queen</span> in a white robe, cut like a Grecian
robe, with flowing sleeves. It has a border of golden
hearts, cut from gold paper. She has a girdle of heavy
gold cord, with a heart at each end, also a tiara of
lighter gold cord, surmounted by a heart of gold. She
carries a sceptre of gold, surmounted by a heart. Choose
a pretty girl for the part.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Her Maidens</span> are in pale blue and silver. The dresses
are made from crepe paper, with double skirts, full
waists, and large sashes. The waists have Dutch necks
and short puffed sleeves. Trim the neck, sleeves and
both skirts with silver tinsel. The stockings may be blue
or white, the slippers white or black. The hair should
be flowing, held back from the face with a band of blue,
edged with the silver, tied in a bow at the side, little silver
hearts dangling from the ends of the bow. On the
upper skirt, or tunic, is a row of silver hearts. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
carries a scarf or ribbon about two yards long, and four
or five inches wide. These may be of some sheeny
lining material. Point the ends, and hang a silver heart
from each end, and from the centre. When the scarfs
are not in use, they are thrown over the head, and
hang down, in front, over the shoulders. They may be
blue, to match the costume, or pink, of a shade that will
harmonize with the blue.</p>

<p><span class="ch">St. Valentine</span> wears a long, white robe, girded with
red and decorated with red hearts. He has a long white
beard, easily removable, also a red cap or hood, to which
is sewed long white hair. He carries a large, handsome
valentine.</p>

<p><span class="ch">His Attendants</span> wear long red robes, girded with
white. Each carries a valentine.</p>

<p><span class="ch">His Pages</span> are two tiny boys, in white robes, with red
girdles. All these robes should be so fashioned that
they may be quickly and easily thrown off. Underneath
all are dressed in court costumes, of red and white&mdash;long
hose, puffed trunks, doublet or tunic, belted in, and
puffed sleeves.</p>

<p><span class="ch">The Queen’s Pages</span> are tiny girls in white, fluffy
dresses. One has a big sash and hair ribbon of pink,
also stockings to match. The other has them of blue.
They have also bows at the shoulders, with short loops,
and long ends. The blue ribbon has golden hearts attached
to the ends; the pink one has silver hearts.</p>

<p><span class="ch">The Fairy</span> is all in fluffy white. Her dress is made
of mosquito netting, very short and full, with a full
empire waist. White ribbons of varying lengths hang
from the folded girdle, also from a band which encircles
the low, round neck. To each of these ribbons is fastened
a tiny silver bell. The sleeves are merely deep ruffles,
cut in points, to each of which is sewed a bell. The slippers
have rosettes, with the bells. Around the head is a
white band, to the lower side of which the little bells are
fastened. To the centre of this, in front, is fastened a
silver star. Her wand is white, with a silver star at
the end. Below the star are several streamers, with the
bells.</p>

<p><span class="ch">Cupid</span> is a tiny boy, in a short, scant slip of pale pink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
over very short white trousers or trunks&mdash;short enough
not to show. The slip is cut straight, with low neck
and no sleeves. A drapery of white mosquito netting,
passing over left shoulder, and under right arm, nearly
covering slip, gives a fleecy, cloud-like effect. He has
little wings of pale pink, and wears no shoes nor stockings.
He carries a little silver bow and a golden arrow.
A quiver holding two or three more arrows may be
slung from his right shoulder, and hang at his left side.</p>

<p class="scene">SCENE.&mdash;<i>The Palace of Hearts. The throne, in the
centre background, is a chair, set upon a raised dais,
the whole draped with purple. Upon the floor, in the
centre of the space left before the throne, draw a large
circle. Divide it into eight parts, by lines crossing at
centre. Draw a smaller circle inside the other, having
for a radius one-third the radius of the larger circle.

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> Meet in front of throne, and form single line.
March down to A. First girl passes down line to E.
Next girl passes to O, then to D; third girl to O, then to
F, others to C, G, B and H, all first passing to O. Last
girl remains at A. During this figure they hold scarfs
above head in both hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> Each girl tosses end of scarf to next girl.
March entirely around circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span> Face centre, raise scarfs high, still held as in
fig. 2, trip sidewise around circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span> Recover scarfs. Hold them in both hands,
right hand high, left low, and march in, along lines, to
inner circle. March around inner circle, scarfs in right
hands nearly meeting, high in centre, like spokes of a
wheel, march back lines to places again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span> Hold strips high over head, turn around in
places, once and a half times, bringing faces to centre
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span> Girls at A and E march up lines to meet at O,
cross scarfs, march around, then march up to J and N,
where each raises scarf above head, turns completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
around, and then marches on to A and E. Girls at C and
G repeat this figure, then those at B and F, and lastly
those at H and D.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span> All march completely around circle, swinging
scarfs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span> Girls at A, E, C and G march to inner circle,
then around it, then halt on J, N, Q and L, and toss ends
of scarfs to each other. Raise them high. Remaining
girls march down lines, pass between girls, and march in
tiny circle inside. They then pass through, between J
and L, and march in circle outside them, then pass in
again, between J and L, and wind in and out. Repeat
this winding, but first girl stop when she reaches R, next
one on P, third on M and last on K. Toss scarfs, and
raise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span> Scarfs so held, all sidestep around this inner
circle, then lower arms and recover scarfs. Step backward
to places on large circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span> Hold scarfs in both hands, dropped easily at
sides. Turn as if to march around circle. First girl
marches down to J, along inner circle to K, up line to B,
along outer circle to C, in on line to L, along to M, and
so on, till she reaches A again. As she passes down first
line, second girl moves from H to A, next girl from G to
H, and so on, all moving up one place. As first girl
moves up second line, girl now at A moves up first line,
all others moving on one place. As second girl passes
up second line, third girl moves down first line, and so on.
Each girl performs the whole figure, which is much easier
than would appear from description, as each simply follows
the one ahead of her, keeping the proper distance
between them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span> March completely around circle. Then, led
by girls at A and E, half turning each way, march on
circle, and up E O and down A O, to centre. Here,
leaders cross scarfs, march around, then on to C and G.
Next ones do the same, and so on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 12.</span> March on, on circle, to B and H, marking
time, to allow all to complete fig. 11; then march down
lines to F and D, crossing at centre, then on, to places on
circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span> March completely around circle, face centre,
march in to inner circle. Girls at J and N raise scarfs,
step to centre, back around each other and to place again.
Girls at Q and L repeat this; then girls at R and M; and
lastly, those at K and P. March backward to large
circle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span> Run in to inner circle, waving scarfs, then
around inner circle, still waving.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span> Girl at J stands still. Girls at R and K run
up to B and H, followed by those at Q and L, while one
at J steps to centre, and those at P and M move up, and
follow, J and N, stepping to P and M. As each reaches
B or H, she runs to her place at side of throne, till all are
in place.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
